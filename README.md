## ðŸ“š About the Author
I am Josie Saxon, a retired **speech-pathologist** and **behavior analyst** who has worked with children my entire career. My passion has always been helping kids find their voices, celebrate small wins, and grow into confident, mindful individuals.  

This book is an extension of that mission â€” giving families a fun and simple way to practice gratitude together.
